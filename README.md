# ðŸ”‘ Hotkey Help

Installer for a quick hotkey helper for you current terminal, supports `bash` and `zsh`.

## Usage

Either use the command `key-help` or the hot keys `ctrl+x+h` for the print out. Your current terminal buffer will be carried over if you use the hotkey.

## Installation

### With npm

`npx hotkey-help`

Since npx runs in a non-interactive shell you may need to start a new window or run `source ~/.bashrc`/`source ~/.zshrc`

### Otherwise

- Clone repo
- `Chmod +x ./kelp.sh`
- `source ./kelp.sh`

Alternatively you can simply run `./print-keys.sh` for the print out.
